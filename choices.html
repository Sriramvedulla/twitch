            <h1>Your Privacy Controls & Choices</h1>
          <h2>Control Your Privacy Settings</h2>
          <p><b>You have the ability to control who sees your content and personal information, and how it affects your experience on Twitch.</b>
            For example, you can disable notifications that are not relevant to you and keep notifications that are important to you about your stream. Someone might not want marketing emails, but they might want to know when an opportunity for streamers arises. They might not want emails when someone follows them, but they might want a text when something in their payout details changes.</p>
            <p>Here’s a breakdown of how you can adjust your privacy settings to best suit your needs: </p>
